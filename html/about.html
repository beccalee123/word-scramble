        <p>Jake grew up on legos, little did he know they wouldn't just be the building blocks of the castle he was
          making but also the building blocks for problem solving skills and lego piece bartering skills. Will graduate
          Code Fellows in February of 2019 with a degree in software design. If there's one thing that puts the motion
          in
          this man's ocean commotion it's playing card games with friends.

            To all future 201 students who are seeing this as an example of what a really great project looks like: stick
            to it, study hard and stay in school! You'll make it! By now hopefully I'm working at some legit tech company
            building powerful tools that help tons of people!
            I enjoy walks on the beach and popping the bulbs on the ends of those long kelp things.

        <p>Brent is an aspiring Software Developer who loves a good puzzle. Originally from the Midwest he longed to
          visit the ocean, and now can enjoy this delightful experience whenever he wants. When not hard at working
          learning software development he enjoys spending time with his wife, reading, hiking, enjoying a fine cigar,
          and playing games of all kinds. If you are interested in seeing more of his work please visit his GitHub or
          follow him on Twitter.

          <p>Becca is a voracious learner who loves to translate her knowledge and intuition into thoughtful,
            user-focused
            strategies. She's currently learning about JavaScript at Code Fellows and is excited to apply her learning
            and
            creativity to user-centric apps (and yes, as a stereotypical Virgo she is absolutely keeping a list of app
            ideas she's excited to build someday). Before learning to code, Becca worked as a tech marketer at
            Formidable.
            She loves the ocean, particularly the deep sea, because tbh, deep sea creatures are EXTREMELY cool.
