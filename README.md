## A Word Scramble Game with an Oceanic Theme
A word scramble game by Becca Lee, Brent Woodward, Fletcher LaRue, and Jacob Anderson for our Code Fellows 201d40 final project. This project represents what the team could accomplish after only 3 weeks of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Date
Completed October of 2018.  
Total time coding: 4 days Monday thru Tursday  
October 29 thru Nov 1, 2018 (4 days)  
Some project layout was completed during the prior weekend

## Project scope
Our game (Ocean Theme) will present the user with a word, randomly selected from themed word bank of at least 100 words, that has been randomly shuffled. They will have to unscramble the word and input the correct answer in the submission field. The game will have an overall time limit of 5 minutes, the game at start will have 2 minutes on the clock,  and when the correct answer is given additional time will be awarded up to the maximum game time. The timer will be represented graphically. Upon completion of the game, a score will be presented and the user will be given the opportunity to submit their score to the High-Score page. Navigation buttons will change color to visually indicate the page you are on. There will be a skip button to allow for passing of words, but at a penalty. In addition if an accurate word is guessed, but it doesn’t fit the theme, the user will be notified.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to https://www.the-art-of-web.com/html/input-field-uppercase/ for the forceKeyPressUppercase function we sourced for our text input field. It helped us keep our game as user friendly as possible and improved gameplay.
